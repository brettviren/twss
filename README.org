#+title: Thread (FFTW in Eigen3) With Simple Safety

* What is?

A simple thread-safe implementation of the second template parameter
of ~Eigen::FFT~

* How do?

#+begin_src c++
  #include <eigen3/unsupported/Eigen/FFT>
  #include <twss.hpp>
  using MyFFT = Eigen::FFT<double, twss::fftw_impl<double> >;
  
  // thread worker function
  void my_worker(MyFFT& fft) { /* use fft with confidence */ }
#+end_src

* How does?

~twss~ simply provides a variant of ~Eigen::internal::fftw_impl<T>~ which
adds ~std::mutex~ locks around any plan construction. No big whoop.

* No way!

Yes way.  But, user beware.  This is not just extending "unsupported"
API but via a private interface.  Given there's been no movement on
~Eigen::FFT~ in like forever, and given you must have already accepted
use of "unsupported" code to care, it's probably okay to use this.
